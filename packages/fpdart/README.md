## Introduction

> **fpdart is fully documented. You do not need to have any previous experience with functional programming to start using `fpdart`. Give it a try!**

fpdart is inspired by [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/), [cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses.html#type-classes-in-cats), and [dartz](https://github.com/spebbe/dartz).

### [Option](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/option.dart)
Used when a return value can be missing.
> For example, when parsing a `String` to `int`, since not all `String`
> can be converted to `int`

```dart
/// Create an instance of [Some]
final option = Option.of(10);

/// Create an instance of [None]
final none = Option<int>.none();

/// Map [int] to [String]
final map = option.map((a) => '$a');

/// Extract the value from [Option]
final value = option.getOrElse(() => -1);

/// Pattern matching
final match = option.match(
  () => print('None'),
  (a) => print('Some($a)'),
);

/// or use Dart's pattern matching as well 🤝
final dartMatch = switch (option) {
  None() => 'None',
  Some(value: final a) => 'Some($a)',
};

/// Convert to [Either]
final either = option.toEither(() => 'missing');

/// Chain computations
final flatMap = option.flatMap((a) => Option.of(a + 10));

/// Return [None] if the function throws an error
final tryCatch = Option.tryCatch(() => int.parse('invalid'));
```

### [Either](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/either.dart)
Used to handle errors (instead of `Exception`s).
> `Either<L, R>`: `L` is the type of the error (for example a `String` explaining
> the problem), `R` is the return type when the computation is successful

```dart
/// Create an instance of [Right]
final right = Either<String, int>.of(10);

/// Create an instance of [Left]
final left = Either<String, int>.left('none');

/// Map the right value to a [String]
final mapRight = right.map((a) => '$a');

/// Map the left value to a [int]
final mapLeft = right.mapLeft((a) => a.length);

/// Return [Left] if the function throws an error.
/// Otherwise return [Right].
final tryCatch = Either.tryCatch(
  () => int.parse('invalid'),
  (e, s) => 'Error: $e',
);

/// Extract the value from [Either]
final value = right.getOrElse((l) => -1);

/// Chain computations
final flatMap = right.flatMap((a) => Either.of(a + 10));

/// Pattern matching
final match = right.match(
  (l) => print('Left($l)'),
  (r) => print('Right($r)'),
);

/// or use Dart's pattern matching as well 🤝
final dartMatch = switch (right) {
  Left(value: final l) => 'Left($l)',
  Right(value: final r) => 'Right($r)',
};

/// Convert to [Option]
final option = right.toOption();
```

### [IO](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/io.dart)
Wrapper around an **sync** function. Allows to compose synchronous functions **that never fail**.

```dart
/// Create instance of [IO] from a value
final IO<int> io = IO.of(10);

/// Create instance of [IO] from a sync function
final ioRun = IO(() => 10);

/// Map [int] to [String]
final IO<String> map = io.map((a) => '$a');

/// Extract the value inside [IO] by running its function
final int value = io.run();

/// Chain another [IO] based on the value of the current [IO]
final flatMap = io.flatMap((a) => IO.of(a + 10));
```

### [Task](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/task.dart)
Wrapper around an **async** function (`Future`). Allows to compose asynchronous functions **that never fail**.

> If you look closely, it's the same as [`IO`](#io) but for **async functions** 💡

```dart
/// Create instance of [Task] from a value
final Task<int> task = Task.of(10);

/// Create instance of [Task] from an async function
final taskRun1 = Task(() async => 10);
final taskRun2 = Task(() => Future.value(10));

/// Map [int] to [String]
final Task<String> map = task.map((a) => '$a');

/// Extract the value inside [Task] by running its async function
final int value = await task.run();

/// Chain another [Task] based on the value of the current [Task]
final flatMap = task.flatMap((a) => Task.of(a + 10));
```

### Utility types
These types compose together the 4 above ([`Option`](#option), [`Either`](#either), [`IO`](#io), [`Task`](#task)) to join together their functionalities:
- [`IOOption`](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/io_option.dart): sync function (`IO`) that may may miss the return value (`Option`)
- [`IOEither`](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/io_either.dart): sync function (`IO`) that may fail (`Either`)
- [`TaskOption`](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/task_option.dart): async function (`Task`) that may miss the return value (`Option`)
- [`TaskEither`](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/task_either.dart): async function (`Task`) that may fail (`Either`)


### [Reader](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/reader.dart)
Read values from a **context** without explicitly passing the dependency between multiple nested function calls. View the [example folder for an explained usecase example](/packages/fpdart/example/src/reader).

#### [ReaderTask](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/reader_task.dart)
Combine the `Reader` type (dependecy) with `Task` (asynchronous).

#### [ReaderTaskEither](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/reader_task_either.dart)
Combine the `Reader` type (dependecy) with `Task` (asynchronous) and `Either` (error handling).

### [State](/packages/fpdart/lib/src/state.dart)
Used to **store**, **update**, and **extract** state in a functional way. View the [example folder for an explained usecase example](/packages/fpdart/example/src/state).

### 🔗 Do notation
Version `v0.6.0` introduced the **Do notation** in `fpdart`. Using the Do notation makes chaining functions easier.

For example, a typical chain of methods in `fpdart` looks as follows:

```dart
/// Without the Do notation
String goShopping() => goToShoppingCenter()
    .alt(goToLocalMarket)
    .flatMap(
      (market) => market.buyBanana().flatMap(
            (banana) => market.buyApple().flatMap(
                  (apple) => market.buyPear().flatMap(
                        (pear) => Option.of('Shopping: $banana, $apple, $pear'),
                      ),
                ),
          ),
    )
    .getOrElse(
      () => 'I did not find 🍌 or 🍎 or 🍐, so I did not buy anything 🤷‍♂️',
    );
```

Notice how you need to call `flatMap` multiple times to collect multiple variables and use them together (`market`, `banana`, `apple`, `pear`).

Everything looks more **linear and simple** by using the Do notation:

```dart
/// Using the Do notation
String goShoppingDo() => Option.Do(
      ($) {
        final market = $(goToShoppingCenter().alt(goToLocalMarket));
        final amount = $(market.buyAmount());

        final banana = $(market.buyBanana());
        final apple = $(market.buyApple());
        final pear = $(market.buyPear());

        return 'Shopping: $banana, $apple, $pear';
      },
    ).getOrElse(
      () => 'I did not find 🍌 or 🍎 or 🍐, so I did not buy anything 🤷‍♂️',
    );
```


You initialize the Do notation using the **`Do()` constructor**.

You have access to a `$` function, that you can use to extract and use the value inside each `Option`, without using `flatMap`.

> **Note**: We recommend using the Do notation whenever possible to improve the legibility of your code 🤝

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Pay attention to avoid the following mistakes when using the **Do notation**:
> - Do not `throw` inside the **`Do()`** constructor
> - Do not `await` without executing the `$` function
> - Do not use a nested **`Do()`** constructor inside another one
> - Do not call the `$` function inside another callback in the **`Do()`** constructor
>
> Using the **Do notation** in these cases may fail at runtime or may produce unexpected behavior. For more information take a look at [the `Do Notation` discussion](https://github.com/SandroMaglione/fpdart/issues/26) or at this [issue](https://github.com/SandroMaglione/fpdart/issues/139).
> Examples for each of the pitfalls can be viewed here: [do-constructor-pitfalls](https://github.com/SandroMaglione/fpdart/tree/main/examples/do_constructor_pitfalls)

### 📦 Immutable Collections

> If you are going to use `fpdart` in your project, make sure to use immutable collections as well ☝️

Immutability is **at the core of functional programming** (alongside pure functions 🤝).

`fpdart` does **not** provide immutable collections. Instead, we strongly suggest to use the [`fast_immutable_collections`](https://pub.dev/packages/fast_immutable_collections) package. 

[`fast_immutable_collections`](https://pub.dev/packages/fast_immutable_collections) provides all the necessary immutable collections (`List`, `Set`, `Map` and more) with an extensive API and [top-class performance](https://pub.dev/packages/fast_immutable_collections#12-benchmarks).


`fpdart` instead provides some extension methods on `Iterable`, `List`, and `Map`. These are designed to **extend the native Dart API with immutable methods**, as well as providing many handy additional functions:

```dart
/// Dart: `1`
[1, 2, 3, 4].first;

/// fpdart: `Some(1)`
[1, 2, 3, 4].head;

/// Dart: Throws a [StateError] ⚠️
[].first;

/// fpdart: `None()`
[].head;

final map = {'a': 1, 'b': 2};

/// Dart: mutable ⚠️
map.updateAll((key, value) => value + 10);

/// fpdart: immutable equivalent 🤝
final newMap = map.mapValue((value) => value + 10);
```


You can use these extension methods on any native Dart collection and **also** in combination with [`fast_immutable_collections`](https://pub.dev/packages/fast_immutable_collections) immutable collections.

## 💡 Motivation

📚 [**Read the full story of the origin and motivation for `fpdart`**](https://www.sandromaglione.com/techblog/the-history-of-fpdart-functional-programming-in-dart)

Functional programming is becoming more and more popular, and for good reasons.

Many non-functional languages are slowly adopting patterns from functional languages, dart included. Dart already supports higher-order functions, generic types, type inference. Since Dart 3, the language supports also [pattern matching](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/546), [destructuring](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/207), [multiple return values](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/68) ([**Read more about these new features here**](https://www.sandromaglione.com/techblog/records-and-patterns-dart-language)).

Other functional programming features are coming to the language, like [higher-order types](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1655).

Many packages are bringing functional patterns to dart, like the amazing [freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) for unions/pattern matching.

fpdart aims to provide all the main types found in functional languages to dart. Types like `Option` (handle missing values without `null`), `Either` (handle errors and error messages), `Task` (composable async computations), and more.

### Goal

Differently from many other functional programming packages, `fpdart` aims to introduce functional programming to every developer. For this reason, every type and method is commented and documented directly in the code.

> **You do not need to have any previous experience with functional programming to start using `fpdart`.**

fpdart also provides [real-world examples](https://github.com/SandroMaglione/fpdart/tree/main/examples/) of why a type is useful and how it can be used in your application. Check out [**my website**](https://www.sandromaglione.com/) for blog posts and articles.

### Comparison with `dartz`

One of the major pain points of dartz has always been is [**lack of documentation**](https://github.com/spebbe/dartz/issues/36). This is a huge issue for people new to functional programming to attempt using the package.

`dartz` was [released in 2016](https://github.com/spebbe/dartz/commits/master?after=2de2f2787430dcd4ef49485bbf8aac1f8d1ff157+279&branch=master), initially targeting Dart 1.

`dartz` is also missing some features and types (`Reader`, `TaskEither`, and others).

`fpdart` is a rewrite based on fp-ts and cats. The main differences are:

- fpdart is fully documented.
- fpdart implements higher-kinded types using [defunctionalization](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf).
- fpdart is based on **Dart 3**.
- fpdart is completely null-safe from the beginning.
- fpdart has a richer API.
- fpdart implements some missing types in dartz.
- fpdart does not provide implementation for immutable collections (`ISet`, `IMap`, `IHashMap`, `AVLTree`).

## 🤔 Roadmap

Being documentation and stability important goals of the package, every type will go through an implementation-documentation-testing cycle before being considered as _'stable'_.

The current work on `fpdart` aims to:
- Expand the API to include more methods to work and convert between types easier (send [an issue](https://github.com/SandroMaglione/fpdart/issues) on the repository if you have a suggestion) 
- Simplify the current API to make it easier to use and learn
- Expand the documentation with more articles and [documentation comments](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/documentation#do-use--doc-comments-to-document-members-and-types)

> **Note**: There is also an experimental research in progress to implement [`ZIO`](https://zio.dev/) in `fpdart`, stay tuned 🔜

***

The long-term goal is to provide **all the main types and typeclasses available in other functional programming languages and packages**. All the types should be **completely** documented and fully tested.

A well explained documentation is the key for the long-term success of the project. **Any article, blog post, or contribution is welcome**.

In general, **any contribution or feedback is welcome** (and encouraged!).
